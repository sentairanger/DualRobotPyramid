# DualRobotPyramid

## Introduction

After successfully running my robots using Flask and Django I moved on to the most difficult web framework, Pyramid. This was the most challenging framework I've ever used. And like my previous projects I now integrated them to Docker, Kubernetes and ArgoCD. I will show you how to run the app on its own, then on Docker, Kubernetes and then on ArgoCD.
